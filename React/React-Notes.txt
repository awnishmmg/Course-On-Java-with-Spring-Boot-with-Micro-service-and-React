We have to start our session in React JS:-
React :- it is stack of MERN 

M : mongodb 
E : Express JS 
R : React Js 
N : Node Js 

1. All these are Technology of Javascript.
2. Pre-requistic you must little bit javascript.
3. html and css is Must.

in Javascript :-
1. Basic 
	1. loops,decision loops, let const,var 
	2. functions, arrow functions, Events
	3. dom manupulations 
	3. callback, Higher order functions,Anonymous functions 
	4. local storage, scope resolutions 
	5. promises, async,await and fetch api.
	
	1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript (Best| Time constraint)
	2. https://javascript.info (straight to the point)
	

React JS : Multiple Tech stack.
React JS : Front end Framework (Js library facebook(Meta))

Backend : Python + Django/Fask 
Front End : React Js 

Java : Backend(java with Spring Boot,Microservice Rest Api)
Front End : React Js 

Framework other then React Js :-
===============================
Angular/React/Vuejs/Svelet Js/Alpine JS/Angular Js.

Important React about React:-
1. React is front end framework (library.)
2. SPA based Application (SPA : Single Page Application)
   Eg : MPA : multi page applicaiton 
   
   Multiple pages -> single index.html -> React use for its internal purpose.
   
   in case java with jsp:-
   About.jsp 
   gallery.jsp 
   contact.jsp
   home.jsp
   
   Application heavy -> front Architecture : MPA Based (Multi page application)
   Multiple Pages/ Load Time/Performance effect.
   
   In React we have single index.html 
   All the Views as written as logic in form class or functions.
   -About.js -> class or functions
   -gallery.js -> class or functions
   -contact.js -> class or functions
   -home.js  -> class or functions
    
	The Application Logic which you write in Js in form class and functions 
	is only component.
	
	consider we want make a website 
	1. gallery.html
	2. home.html
    3. About.html
	4. contact.html
	5. service.html
	
	The core of the React is component based Architecture.
	Now since there no page, hence memory will also will not be consumed.
	
3. React works on the basis of 2 concepts.
   1. JSX 
   2. Virtual DOM.
   
  what is JSX ?
  Jsx : Javascript + XML  = React Code 
  XML : Extensible Markup langauge somehting like html.
  
  html works in readymade tags 
  xml works on the basis custom or user defined.
  
  DOM :- 
  Javascript object based : Ready Made Object
  Java object oriented : Custom Object.
  
  Javascript (Vanilla Js):-
  ============================
  2 main Object 
  1. BOM : Browser Object Model 
		 window.alert()
		 window.confirm()
		 window.prompt()
		 ...
		 ...
  2. DOM : Document Object Model 
		1. Tags,forms Elements,urls...
		
		<!doctype html>
		<html>
			<head>
			</head>
			<body>
				<h1> Hello world</html>
			</body>
		</html>
      All the Tags are recognised by the,Browser.
      -Browser can be firebox,chrome,(Safari,MS Edge),Opera,Brave
	  All these tags are real tags and indetified by browser.
	  browser will occupy memory as well.
	  
	  React -> Js but also we can xml (<AWNISH></AWNISH>)
	  Awnish Tag : it is not real Tag.
	  it will create a virtual DOM 
	  and will not occupy any memory.
	  
	  
			Browser 
			  |
		Window Object 
	          |
          Document 
             |
            html
       --------------
       |             |
     Head	        body	
   
	window.oncontextmenu = function(){
       return false;
    }
	
	concept of virtual DOM:-
	======================
	I dont know React How can I implement My Virtual Dom in Javascript?
